            <button class="accordion">1. How much does a typical deck cost?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    The cost of a typical deck will vary. Specific factors involved in pricing include choosing between
                    the different types of material and the size of the project. Different sizes of decks will use
                    different sizes of wood as beams like 2x8 or 2x10 or 2x12 . We will design it for you and choose
                    what's best for you.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">2. What are the benefits of adding a deck to your home?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>From watching the sunset, reading a book in the afternoon or enjoying a BBQ with your family and
                    friends, a brand new deck will help make it a more memorable time. Adding a deck to your home is an
                    investment, but in the long run it will be worthwhile. Not only will it enhance the exterior of your
                    house it will also increase the property value.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">3. What type of fencing is usually used to secure a residential property?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The type of fencing will vary depending on what community you are in. In newer communities,
                    pressure-treated wood is usually used as there are architectural guidelines that need to be
                    followed. For older communities, we recommend vinyl fencing as it doesn’t need staining or
                    maintenance and has life-time material warranty. Come take a look at our showroom to see what kind
                    of fencing material we offer.

            <button class="accordion">4. How long does it take to install a new fence?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>To install a new fence or deck it will usually take less than 1 week. At A&R Construction, we
                    communicate with you to make sure projects are done in a timely manner and give you the best quality

            <button class="accordion">5. Do I need to get a permit to build a deck?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Decks under 2 feet are not required to get a permit. However, if your deck is 2 feet or higher a
                    permit is required. But have no worries, we will handle all of that for you.
